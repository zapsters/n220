    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>

        <p>
          You wake up in the swamp, recognizing it as a nearby place just beyond the town. The
          basket you brought with you to collect mushrooms lays by your side, half spilt.
        </p>
        <p>"I must've fallen," you think.</p>
        <p>
          You get to your feet, in the distance is the town's bridge leading outside of the towns
          limit. You've only been out here once or twice before, but you do know you have a better
          chance at finding undisturbed nature and mushrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also know that leaving the town is dangerous, but you also consider the potential of
          finding new rocks and mushrooms across the rickety bridge.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#crossBridge">Venture across the bridge</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#returnTown">Head back towards the town</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="crossBridge">
        <p>
          The wood beneath your feet creeks and bends as you walk across. Visions of the bridge
          collapsing fill your head. Once your reach solid ground, you collect yourself after that
          terrifying journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little further you find yourself at a crossroads. The mountains is to the left, a place
          you've heard stories about people getting lost there. To the right you see a path, blocked
          by a fallen tree blocking the path on the horizon.
        </p>
        <p>You hesitate before finally choosing...</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#mountains">Go towards the mountains</a></li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="mountains">
        <p>
          You walk along the path as the mountains, entering a valley between a break in the
          mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          You spot some mushrooms by the opening of a cave! You venture off the path towards the
          cave, noting a small cabin in the distance. "A perfect spot for this kind of life" you
          think as you get closer to the cave opening. As you bend down to get a closer look, a big
          roar comes from behind you.
        </p>
        <p>A bear has found you! Quick!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#run">Run towards the cabin!</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#standoff">Prepare for a fight!</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="standoff">
        <p>You ready your fists and bring up your weapon... a basket?</p>
        <p>
          You realize you hadn't brought your knife with you, a foolish mistake. Good thing you have
          some strong arms though.
        </p>
        <p>
          You hurl the basket at the bear. It hits its face, only moderatly stunning it. It looks
          back at you, seemingly almost out of annoyance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bear suddenly turns to a human, rubbing the side of its head. "Ow dude, that hurt,"
          the once bear speaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          You apologize, picking up your basket and taking some of the flowers you can pick up. You
          hand one of the yellow ones to him and mumble another apology as you speed walk back home.
        </p>
        <p>That was close.</p>
        <a href="#index">Head back home.</a>
      </div>
      <div id="run">
        <p>
          You dodge and weave through the trees, finally making it to the cabin you saw earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          You slam the door behind you, making the whole cabin shake and groan in response. You're
          safe, for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you recollect yourself, you see a vast collection of wildlife, plants, and fungi around
          the place. You can hardly contain your excitment, forgetting for just a second the bear
          that was after you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You enjoy the sights, only taking a few loose collectables not on display. You wonder who
          lives here, wanting to meet them one day.
        </p>
        <a href="#index">Head home through the trees, careful to avoid the beast.</a>
      </div>
      <div id="fallenTree">
        <p>
          You head towards the fallen tree where you see a vast collection of fungi living on the
          tree! There are many types you find, you take out your adventuring book and turn to the
          mushroom identification page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some types you can't really identify. "Thats the fun in adventuring," you think to
          yourself, "something new everytime."
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#nibble">A little nibble couldn't hurt!</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#collect">Collect mushroom samples</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="nibble">
        <p>You grab a large chunk of one of the mushrooms, shoving it in your mouth excitedly.</p>
        <p>
          Later, on your walk home, you notice you feel sick. You hope a good nights sleep will
          help...
        </p>
        <a href="#index">Return to start</a>
      </div>
      <div id="collect">
        <p>
          You grab multiple samples, putting them in your basket, noting in your adverturing book
          which types you found today. You turn and walk back home with a smile.
        </p>
        <a href="#index">Return to start</a>
      </div>
      <div id="returnTown">
        <p>
          It never hurt to play it safe you think as you turn back home. You wonder if you made the
          right decision, maybe another day you can venture past that bridge.
        </p>
        <p>
          On your walk back, you notice a small clearing into a pond further into the trees. Some
          bright flowers catch your eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can hear the chickens from the farm just a little ahead. The chickens have always been
          there for you and sometimes just visitng them is nice.
        </p>
        <p>Visit the pond or the continue to town?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#pond">Visit the pond</a>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="pond">
        <p>
          You hold your hand up to block the sun from your eyes, catching a glimpse of some movement
          under the water! You look closer to see some fish and even some frogs across the pond!
        </p>
        <p>
          You collect a few flowers and put them in your basket, thinking about the collection you
          are growing back home.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#jumpIn">Jump in the pond!</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#sitAndEnjoy">Take a moment and sit in the grass</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="jumpIn">
        <p>
          You set your basket down against a rock before turning and doing a big jump into the pond.
          You see waves and ripples replace the once still water you just disturbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coldness hits you after a second. You hear some shuffling in the bushes beyond the
          pond, but the sound quickly receeds. I wonder what you missed?
        </p>
        <a href="#index">Head back home. Soaked.</a>
      </div>
      <div id="sitAndEnjoy">
        <p>
          You set your basket down next to you, full of various flowers and mushrooms you have found
          on your adventure. The sound of the forest surrounds you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bubbles rise from inside the pond, you think about what types of fish might be living down
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          You go still as the sound of shuffling bushes breaks up the ambient sound of the forest.
          Two little white ears appear over the bushes first.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fox emerges from the bushes! It gives you a quick look, then quickly shuffles to the
          pond, drinking some of the water. It looks up at you again, this time less questioning and
          more curiousity. You give a little wave before the fox turns and heads back towards where
          it came from.
        </p>
        <a href="#index">Head back home.</a>

      <div id="town">
        <p>
          Town is bustling this afternoon. Merchants wonder the streets, people are gathered at the
          local market, the farm animals are loudly celebrating the day, and the blacksmith is hard
          at work banging away at some new tool.
        </p>
        <p>You take in the town for just a second, admiring its beauty.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#farm">Visit the farm and visit the animals.</a>

      </div>
      <div id="farm">
        <p>
          You visit the coop, the chickens inside are clucking inside. You can see some through a
          little window on the side of the coop. Their colors are amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You manage to carefully reach in and pet some chickens, careful to not let them bite you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You decide it is time to head back home, you say bye to the chickens and make your way
          home.
        </p>
        <a href="#index">Head home.</a>
      </div>
      <div id="blacksmith">
        <p>
          The blacksmith is working on a new tool! It is bight red as you approach. The heat hits
          you as you walk in of the running forage.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm working on a new dagger." he says to you, motioning you to come closer to see his
          work. He is currently working on the handle.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turns to the wall and grabs one of his older daggers. "This one is a little messed up,
          see this spot on the handle?" You inspect the dagger, pretending like you see the spot he
          is talking about, you nod. He responds, "Here, you can take it, i'm sure you'll need it
          next time you head across that bridge." He gives you a wink as he hands it to you.
